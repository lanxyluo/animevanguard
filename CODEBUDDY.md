# CodeBuddy Code Configuration

**Note:** All files have been moved into the `anime-vanguard-project` directory, which is now the root of the project.

This file is used by CodeBuddy Code to understand the repository and assist with development tasks.

## Common Commands

Based on the presence of `index.html`, `js/` and `css/` directories, this appears to be a client-side web project. Common commands for such projects often involve a web server for development and potentially a build step for production.

```bash
# Serve the application (example, actual command may vary)
# python -m http.server 8000
# or use a local dev server like 'live-server'

# Run tests (open `test.html` or `test-filter.html` in a browser)
# No explicit build commands found yet. Further analysis is needed.
```

## High-Level Architecture

This appears to be a client-side web application. 
- `index.html`: The main entry point of the application.
- `js/`: Contains JavaScript files, likely for application logic and interactivity.
- `css/`: Contains CSS files for styling.

Further analysis of the JavaScript files is needed to understand the application's structure and any frameworks/libraries used.

`test-filter.html`: Possibly a filtered version of the test runner.
